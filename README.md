I used a dataset containing the credit card payments that were due for the next month with the amounts and on the basis of various categories such as sex, education and marriage for different accounts . Then performing EDA on it to visualise various plots and graphs to understand the data better and then fitting the data under various models and identifying the best model. Identified 'Random Forest Classifier' as the best model and thn finally converting the best model to a pkl file that is downloadable.
